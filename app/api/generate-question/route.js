Cacti have thick, waxy stems that store water and small spines instead of leaves to reduce water loss. In contrast, rainforest plants face the opposite challenge - too much water and competition for sunlight. So they've evolved differently. Many have large, broad leaves to capture maximum sunlight, and some grow as vines to climb toward the light. Interestingly, both environments led to similar solutions in some cases. Both desert and rainforest plants often have specialized root systems - cacti have shallow, widespread roots to catch rare rainfall, while many rainforest plants have shallow roots too, but to quickly absorb nutrients from decomposing matter on the forest floor.",
