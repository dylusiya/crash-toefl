This lack of human connection can negatively impact their mental health, which undermines the supposed psychological benefits mentioned in the reading passage.\n\nFinally, although the reading emphasizes cost savings and the ability to hire global talent as major advantages, the professor contends that these benefits come at a significant cost.
